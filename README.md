# House Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict house prices using various machine learning models and feature engineering techniques. The project is implemented in Python and utilizes several libraries and tools for data analysis and model building.

## Overview

In this project, we:

- Import essential libraries for data analysis and machine learning.
- Prepare and preprocess the dataset.
- Explore the data using visualizations and statistical analysis.
- Select and engineer relevant features.
- Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
- Choose the best model for predicting house prices.

## Project Structure

- `House_price_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code and analysis.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `statsmodels`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn matplotlib
```
## Usage
**1.Clone the repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
```
**2.Navigate to the project directory:**
```
cd house-price-prediction
```
**3.Open and run the House_price_prediction.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to explore the code, data, and results.**

- The dataset used in this project can be found in the same directory. It includes the following files:

## Future Improvements
 Here are some ideas for future improvements:

- Feature engineering: Explore additional feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.
